        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish, originating in Rome, characterized by a creamy sauce made without cream, using only eggs (usually yolks), Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (pork cheek), and black pepper.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg yolk</li>
            <li>Pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>Pork cheek</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
